Hey, everyone else is making modded jokers so I might as well too!

This is my own joker pack that I've been working on for some time. It currently contains 34 jokers, including 11 commons, 17 uncommons and 6 rares, and I'm not running out of ideas anytime soon. Please notify me on the Balatro discord server if you get any bugs, crashes or unintended behaviour, even with other joker mods because I'd ideally like them to be compatible.

Requires Steamodded to use.
