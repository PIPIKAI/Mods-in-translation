## "Exotic Suit system"?

We added two new suits in a vanillish way - instead of acquiring them right at the beggining, you actually need to get them in the run.\
To make them appear in your run, you must play hand consisting of five different suits, you can do that using Wild Card enhancement.

We developed a lot of special Jokers just for Exotic Suit System! You can check out Wiki if you really want to spoil yourself.

This system was inspired by SixSuits mod and is intended to replace other suit mods.

## FAQ:
**Q:** Where to download?\
**A:** There's should be "releases" thingy on the right. Click on the version it suggests there.

**Q:** How to install?\
**A:** You need Steamodded to play with this mod. [Download here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/releases).\
Then you simply drop the Bunco folder into your mods folder.

**Q:** My game runs in 0.001 fps now, what to do?\
**A:** There's config file, you can disable high quality background in it. 

**Q:** I got crash/something is weird! What do I do?\
**A:** Write details about your issue in Balatro's Discord: [link to the thread](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1220084296346501201/1220084296346501201).

**Q:** I can't see any cards in my collection!\
**A:** That's not a question. But I'll answer anyways, the Jokers are needed to be discovered first, just like in the base game.

## Known bugs/weird things:
- The preview for new Poker Hands is a bit broken visually in the handlist
- Probably doesn't work as intended with other suit mods
